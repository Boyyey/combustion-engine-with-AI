## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/combustion-engine-sim.git
   cd combustion-engine-sim
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   - Windows:
     ```cmd
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, install the packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy PyOpenGL PyOpenGL-accelerate matplotlib
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Simulator

1. **Start the simulation**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Wait for the 3D window to appear** - This might take a few seconds the first time.
